# Sprocket Production Infrastructure Documentation

**Created**: November 8, 2025
**Status**: Complete and Ready for Use
**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation for the Sprocket infrastructure project

---

## Overview

This section contains comprehensive documentation for the Sprocket production infrastructure deployment. It was created as the culmination of an 8-week infrastructure rebuild project (September 14 - November 8, 2025).

### What is Sprocket?

Sprocket is a comprehensive platform for competitive Rocket League esports leagues. It provides the infrastructure and tools to run organized competitive gaming leagues similar to traditional sports leagues.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Player registration and profile management
- League and team management
- Automated matchmaking and scheduling
- Match result processing from replay files
- Discord integration for notifications and interactions
- Statistics tracking and leaderboards

### Infrastructure Scale

As of November 2025:
- **Users**: Hundreds of active players
- **Concurrent Users**: <1,000 (current capacity)
- **Uptime**: 99.9%+ (less than 9 hours downtime per year)
- **Response Time**: <500ms for most requests
- **Infrastructure Cost**: $131/month

## Quick Reference

### Architecture Overview

The infrastructure uses a three-layer architecture:

- **Layer 1**: Core Infrastructure (Traefik, Vault, Socket Proxy)
- **Layer 2**: Data Services (Redis, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB)
- **Platform**: Application Services (Web, API, Discord Bot, Microservices)

### Technology Stack

- **Orchestration**: Docker Swarm
- **Reverse Proxy**: Traefik
- **Secrets Management**: Vault + Doppler
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Digital Ocean Managed)
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ
- **Storage**: Digital Ocean Spaces (S3-compatible)
- **Monitoring**: Grafana + InfluxDB
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Pulumi

### Critical External Dependencies

1. **Doppler** - Secrets management
2. **GitHub Organization** - Vault authentication
3. **Digital Ocean** - Managed database and storage
4. **DNS Provider** - Let's Encrypt certificates
5. **Pulumi Backend** - Infrastructure state management
6. **Docker Hub** - Private image repository

## Key Project Outcomes

### What We Built

Over 8 weeks (September 14 - November 8, 2025), we:

1. Completely rebuilt the infrastructure from scratch
2. Adopted Infrastructure as Code (Pulumi)
3. Implemented proper secrets management (Vault)
4. Set up comprehensive monitoring (Grafana, InfluxDB)
5. Migrated to managed services (PostgreSQL, S3)
6. Documented everything comprehensively

### Results Achieved

- **Uptime**: 99.9%+ (vs. frequent downtime before)
- **Recovery Time**: ~6 hours (vs. days/weeks before)
- **Deployment**: Repeatable and automated
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and production-ready
- **Team Confidence**: Can operate and maintain the platform

### Lessons Learned

1. **Use managed services** for critical infrastructure
2. **Design for production first**, add dev overrides later
3. **Automate secret provisioning** to reduce human error
4. **Document decisions when making them**, not after
5. **Test each layer independently** before stacking
6. **Git history is invaluable** for understanding evolution
