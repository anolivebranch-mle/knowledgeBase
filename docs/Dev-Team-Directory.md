# Dev Team Directory

This page describes the Dev Team Directory initiative, which helps coordinators and tracks contributors and assign tasks.

## Purpose

The Community Directory is designed to:
- Keep track of who is involved in the project
- Make it easy to know who to contact
- Support task assignment based on interests and skills
- Provide an easy first pull request for new contributors

## What Information Is Collected

Each contributor is encouraged to add a single entry containing:

- **Username**
- **Email**
- **GitHub Profile**
- **Real-Life Profession**
- **Sprocket Project Interest**
- **Technical Skills**
- **Skills Interested in Developing**

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Add their information to the directory data file
4. Open a pull request

This allows new contributors to become familiar with Git, GitHub, and the project workflow in a low-pressure way.
